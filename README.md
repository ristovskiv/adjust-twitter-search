# README

Simple web app for searching through Twitter's tweets

## Starting the app

`$ bundle install`

`$ rails s`

Open localhost:3000 and start searching!

## Run tests

`$ rspec`

## TODO

1. Start with refactoring the specs

2. Otherwise since the task was broad there could be tons of possibilites,
maybe add a language param to search for etc.
